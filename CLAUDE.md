## ⚠️ TOP PRIORITY: Mobile-Web Feature Parity

**Every feature built for the web app MUST have a corresponding implementation in the mobile app, and vice versa. This is the single highest priority rule in this codebase.**

- Any new page, action, or data model added to the web app must be mirrored in the mobile app at the same time.
- Any change to a server action, API route, or Prisma model must be reflected in both the web UI and mobile UI.
- Mobile screens consume the same Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) as the web app — never duplicate business logic.
- Do not consider any feature "done" until it works on both platforms.
- When in doubt about scope, ask: "Does this change need a mobile counterpart?" The answer is almost always yes.

## 🎯 NEXT FEATURE: Comprehensive Expense Tracker

> **Full spec lives in KI:** `/Users/uday/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/expense-tracker/artifacts/expense-tracker-spec.md`
> Read it in full before writing a single line of code.

This is the most important feature of the entire application. Key constraints to memorise:

1. **Two-level view:** Central (all events aggregated) at `/expenses` + per-event view at `/expenses/[eventId]`.
2. **Budget is optional** — never require it; never show "remaining" language if no budget is set.
3. **Categories are wedding-level** (not event-level) so they're shared across events. **Must migrate `ExpenseCategory.eventId → weddingId`.**
4. **Payer is free text** — no separate Payer model. Field name: `paidBy String?` on `Expense`.
5. **New Expense fields needed:** `paidBy`, `currency` (INR/AED/USD, default INR), `expenseDate`, `paymentStatus` (PAID/ADVANCE_GIVEN/PENDING).
6. **New models needed:** `ExpenseActivity` (audit log), `ExpenseComment` (per-expense comments).
7. **New Wedding fields:** `splitEnabled Boolean @default(false)`, `splitAgreement String?` (JSON).
8. **New Event field:** `budget String?` (per-event optional budget).
9. **Split is net settlement only** — never split individual expenses. Show a summary card when split is enabled.
10. **Quick-add first** — only Title + Amount + Event are required. Everything else is optional.
11. **Export:** PDF (jsPDF + jspdf-autotable) and CSV/Excel (papaparse + xlsx/SheetJS).
12. **Mobile counterpart required** — update `apps/mobile/app/(tabs)/budget.tsx`.

### New/Changed Routes
- `/expenses` — central view (all events)
- `/expenses/[eventId]` — per-event view
- Nav entry: rename "Budget & Expenses" → "Expenses"

### New Server Actions File
`apps/web/src/actions/expenses.ts` — full CRUD + activity logging + split config + comments

### Packages to install
- `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable` — PDF export
- `xlsx` — Excel export (or use papaparse for CSV-only)

## Project Overview

**GettinHitched** is a full-stack wedding planning platform with a Next.js web app and an Expo React Native mobile app, living in a pnpm monorepo managed by Turborepo.

- Couples create a "wedding" after sign-up (onboarding wizard).
- Every planning object (guests, budget, vendors, tasks, etc.) belongs to a `Wedding`.
- Multiple collaborators (partner, planner, family) can join via invite link with role-based access.
- A public-facing page (`/w/[slug]`) lets guests RSVP without an account.

**Active dev branch:** `claude/wedding-planning-app-yVFpR`
**GitHub repo:** `udscrick/GettinHitched`

---

## Environment Variables

File: `apps/web/.env` (see `apps/web/.env.example` for template)

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
AUTH_SECRET="<openssl rand -base64 32>"
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
AUTH_GOOGLE_ID=""          # optional — Google OAuth
AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET=""      # optional — Google OAuth
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

Google OAuth is optional; credentials (email + bcrypt) always work.

---

## Database

**Engine:** SQLite via Prisma (file: `apps/web/prisma/dev.db`)
**Schema:** `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`

### Models at a glance

```
Auth/User layer
  User · Account · Session · VerificationToken

**Important conventions:**
- Monetary amounts are stored as `String` (not `Float`) to avoid floating-point drift — always `parseFloat()` before math.
- JSON arrays (e.g. `readings`, `eventTimeline`, `nameChangeItems`) are serialised as `String` in SQLite. Parse/stringify in the action layer.
- All models cascade-delete from `Wedding` on delete.

## Development Commands

Run from the **repo root** using pnpm/turbo:

```bash
pnpm dev              # runs both web + mobile (turbo)
pnpm build            # production build (turbo)
pnpm type-check       # tsc --noEmit across all packages
pnpm lint             # eslint across all packages
pnpm db:push          # prisma db push (applies schema to SQLite)
pnpm db:generate      # prisma generate (regenerates client)
pnpm db:seed          # tsx prisma/seed.ts
pnpm db:studio        # Prisma Studio GUI on :5555
```

Run the web app alone:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm dev              # Next.js on :3000
pnpm type-check       # ts check only this app
```

Run the mobile app:

```bash
cd apps/mobile
pnpm start            # Expo dev server
pnpm android / pnpm ios
```

### Authentication Flow

1. User hits `/sign-up` → creates `User` + hashed password via `/api/register`.
2. Signs in via `/sign-in` (credentials or Google OAuth).
3. NextAuth v5 issues a JWT session; `session.user.id` is the `User.id`.
4. Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) protects all non-public routes. Public routes: `/w/*` and `/api/public/*`.
5. First authenticated visit with no `WeddingMember` record → redirect to `/onboarding`.
6. Onboarding creates `Wedding` + `WeddingMember` (role: OWNER), then redirects to `/dashboard`.

### Server Actions vs. API Routes

- **Server Actions** (`src/actions/*.ts`): mutations triggered from client components (form submits, button clicks). Each action calls `auth()` and `db.weddingMember.findFirst()` to scope to the right wedding before any DB write.
- **API Routes** (`src/app/api/*/route.ts`): used for REST-style reads, file uploads, and the public RSVP endpoint. Some modules (notes, ceremony, reception, venues, invitations, website) have both.

### Dashboard Layout

`(dashboard)/layout.tsx` wraps every authenticated page with:
- `<WeddingContext>` — fetches the current user's `WeddingMember` + `Wedding` and provides it via context.
- `<Sidebar>` — desktop left nav (collapsible).
- `<MobileSidebar>` — sheet-based drawer for mobile.
- `<Topbar>` — breadcrumbs, user menu.

### Navigation Structure (`src/lib/constants/nav.ts`)

```
Overview    → Dashboard
Planning    → Timeline & Checklist | Expenses | Guests & RSVPs | Seating Chart
Vendors     → Vendors | Venues
The Wedding → Ceremony | Reception | Wedding Party
Celebrations→ Engagement | Honeymoon
Creative    → Gallery & Inspiration | Invitations | Gift Registry
Digital     → Wedding Website | Notes & Communications
Admin       → Legal & Documents | Reports | Settings
```

> "Budget & Expenses" renamed to **"Expenses"** pointing to `/expenses`.

### UI Components (`src/components/`)

Custom components following shadcn/ui conventions (Radix primitive + CVA + cn):
`avatar`, `badge`, `button`, `card`, `dialog`, `dropdown-menu`, `input`, `label`, `progress`, `select`, `separator`, `textarea`.

All use the `cn()` utility (`src/lib/utils.ts` — clsx + tailwind-merge).

### Tailwind Design Tokens

The brand palette is defined in `tailwind.config.ts`:
- `champagne` — light warm background
- `champagne-gold` — primary accent (`#C9A96E`)
- `ivory` — page background
- `blush` — soft pink
- `sage` — muted green
- `navy` — deep navy
- `warm-gray` — neutral text

Typography: serif headings (Georgia/Playfair-style via `font-serif`), sans-serif body.

## Module-by-Module Summary

### Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
Server component. Shows: countdown to wedding, key stats (guest count, budget %, tasks done, days left), quick-action cards. Reads directly from `db`.

### Expenses (`/expenses`) — ⚠️ BEING REPLACED/EXPANDED
Previously at `/budget` (`BudgetClient.tsx`). **Being rebuilt** as a comprehensive expense tracker.

**New structure:**
- `/expenses` — Central view aggregating all events. Components: `ExpenseTable`, `CategoryBreakdownCard`, `PayerBreakdownCard`, `BudgetProgressBar`, `SplitSummaryCard`, `ActivityLogFeed`, `ExportMenu`, `FilterBar`.
- `/expenses/[eventId]` — Per-event view scoped to one event.
- Server actions: `src/actions/expenses.ts` (new, replaces `budget.ts`).
- Categories are now **wedding-level** (not event-level) — `ExpenseCategory.weddingId` instead of `eventId`.
- New expense fields: `paidBy`, `currency`, `expenseDate`, `paymentStatus`.
- New models: `ExpenseActivity`, `ExpenseComment`.
- Split feature: toggle + net settlement card (when enabled).
- Export: PDF (jsPDF) + CSV/Excel (papaparse/xlsx).

## Mobile App (`apps/mobile`)

Expo Router tab navigation — 5 tabs:

| Tab | File | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` | Countdown + quick stats |
| Guests | `app/(tabs)/guests.tsx` | Guest list + RSVP status |
| Budget | `app/(tabs)/budget.tsx` | Budget overview |
| Tasks | `app/(tabs)/tasks.tsx` | Task checklist |
| More | `app/(tabs)/more.tsx` | Links to other modules |

Brand colors in tabs: active `#C9A96E` (champagne gold), inactive `#8B7355`, background `#FDF8F5`.

**Current state:** Scaffolded with placeholder UI. Not yet connected to the web API. The mobile app hits the same backend via REST calls (planned — not implemented yet).

---

## Shared Types (`packages/types`)

Import in either app with: `import type { VendorType } from "@gettinhitched/types"`

Key enums: `MemberRole` · `RSVPStatus` · `GuestSide` · `VendorType` · `VendorStatus` · `PaymentStatus` · `TaskPriority` · `PartyRole`

---

## Known Issues & Remaining Work

### Current TypeScript warnings
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/reports/page.tsx` — `Badge` component is used with `variant="warning"` which may not exist in the current badge definition. Needs a `warning` variant added to `src/components/ui/badge.tsx`, or replace with inline styling.
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` — minor type issue; investigate after badge fix.

### Not yet implemented / planned work
- **🎯 Expense Tracker (IN PROGRESS — NEXT FEATURE)**: Full rebuild of `/budget` as comprehensive `/expenses`. See KI at `/Users/uday/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/expense-tracker/`. Schema migrations, new server actions, two-level view, split feature, export, activity log, comments, and mobile counterpart all needed.
- **Mobile ↔ Web API integration**: Mobile app currently has static placeholder data. Needs REST client (likely with `expo-secure-store` for JWT storage) wired to the Next.js API routes.
- **Email sending**: Invitation send flow (`/api/invitations/[batchId]/send/route.ts`) has the structure but no email provider integrated (Resend / Nodemailer recommended).
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple members editing simultaneously will overwrite each other. Consider optimistic locking or Pusher/Ably for live updates.
- **File storage**: Photos currently saved to `public/uploads/` on disk — not suitable for production. Should migrate to S3/R2/Cloudinary.
- **Google OAuth**: Wired in `auth.ts` but requires valid `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` env vars.
- **Push notifications**: `expo-notifications` installed in mobile but not configured.
- **Reporting charts**: Reports page uses only CSS progress bars; Recharts is installed but not yet used on reports (it is used in Budget).
- **Drag-and-drop seating visual canvas**: Current seating page assigns guests to tables but does not render a spatial floor-plan canvas. @dnd-kit is installed.
- **Dark mode**: `next-themes` is installed but no dark theme is wired up yet.
- **Tests**: No test suite exists. Vitest or Jest + React Testing Library recommended.
- **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions workflows yet.
- **Production database**: SQLite is dev-only. Migration to PostgreSQL (Neon/Supabase) needed before any production deployment. Change `datasource.provider` in `schema.prisma` and re-run `prisma migrate`.

## Git Workflow

- Always develop on `claude/wedding-planning-app-yVFpR`.
- Push with: `git push -u origin claude/wedding-planning-app-yVFpR`
- Do not push directly to `main` without an explicit PR.
- Commits are linked to the Claude Code session in the commit body.
